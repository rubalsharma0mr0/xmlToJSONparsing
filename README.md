# xmlToJSONparsing

JSON stands for JavaScript object notation, is a lightweight format for storing and transporting the data. It stores the data as the key-value pair. Most of the applications use this format for transmitting the data from the server to the web page, or vice-versa. However, we can use the org.json.XML class in Java to convert the XML to JSON. This class provides a static method XML.toJSONObject to convert XML to JSON Array.
